I've enjoyed playing and watching soccer since I was a little kid. Starting with my <a href='/assets/pdf/bachelor-thesis.pdf'>BSc thesis</a>, I was able to combine this pashion with my interest in data science. I developed a model for predicting the outcomes of Premier League games, finding that financial features are as informative as performance-based metrics.

During my master's degree, I joined a local startup called <a href="https://matchmetrics.com">matchmetrics</a> and developed models for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240204175435/https://matchmetrics.com/insights/how-can-i-compare-players-across-competitions-and-countries/">predicting player performance across different leagues and countries</a>.

My work culminated in my <a href='/assets/pdf/master-thesis.pdf'>MSc thesis</a>, where I developed a model to predict events in the video feed of a soccer game. The model was able to detect events such as passes, crosses, dribblings, and shots with high accuracy.
