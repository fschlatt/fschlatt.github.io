I had the pleasure of visiting the University of Queensland for 7 weeks as part of an academic exchange program. My gratitude goes out to <a href="https://scells.me/">Harry Scells</a> and Martin Potthast for providing the opportunity to go on the trip and to Guido Zuccon for hosting me at UQ. I had a great time and learned a lot from the visit. Stay tuned for updates on the research I conducted during my stay at UQ.
