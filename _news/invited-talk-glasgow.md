It was my pleasure to be invited to give a talk about my work at the Glasgow Information Retrieval Seminar. I presented my research on <a href="../../assets/pdf/schlatt-2024a.pdf">sparse cross-encoders</a> and a permutation invariant listwise cross-encoder, the <a href="../../assets/pdf/schlatt-2025b.pdf">PI-Listwise Cross-Encoder</a>. Thank you to Zixuan Yi & Jack McKechnie for the invitation and the opportunity to present my work. My slides are available <a href="../../assets/pdf/glasgow-talk.pdf">here</a>.
