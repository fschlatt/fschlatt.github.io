Thank you to <a href="https://scells.me/">Harry Scells</a> for inviting me to give a talk at the University of TÃ¼bingen. I presented my research on the <a href="../../assets/pdf/schlatt-2025b.pdf">Set-Encoder</a>, a permutation-invariant cross-encoder for re-ranking, and the <a href="../../assets/pdf/schlatt-2025d.pdf">Token-Independent Text Encoder</a>, a new transformer-based encoder architecture that substantially improves the efficiency of bi-encoder models. My slides are available <a href="../../assets/pdf/tuebingen-talk.pdf">here</a>.
